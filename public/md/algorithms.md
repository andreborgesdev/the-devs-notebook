# Algorithms

A set of steps/instructions for completing a task.

Algorithmic thinking is really what we want to achieve to more easily and with more agility solve problems.

- Clearly defined problem statement, input, and output
- The steps in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order
- The steps also need to be distinct
- The algorithm should produce a result
- The algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time

We can evaluate an algorithm on **correctness** and **efficiency**.

Divide and conquer: Solving a problem by recursively breaking down the problem into subproblems until it is easily solved.

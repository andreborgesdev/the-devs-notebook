# Algorithms

An **algorithm** is a set of **well-defined steps** or **instructions** to complete a task or solve a problem.

## What Makes an Algorithm

An algorithm should have:

- A **clearly defined problem statement**, input, and output.
- Steps arranged in a **specific, logical order**.
- **Distinct steps** — no ambiguity.
- Must produce a **result**.
- Must complete in a **finite amount of time**.

## Why Algorithms Matter

- Algorithms are the **core of problem-solving** in programming.
- They allow us to solve problems **efficiently** and **scalably**.
- Mastery of algorithms leads to better **coding interviews**, **software design**, and **system performance**.

**Algorithmic thinking** is the ultimate goal:

- Breaking down complex problems.
- Identifying efficient approaches.
- Applying patterns like divide and conquer.

## Evaluating Algorithms

| Criterion       | Description                                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Correctness** | Does the algorithm provide the correct result for all valid inputs?            |
| **Efficiency**  | How much time and memory does it use? Often expressed with **Big O notation**. |

## Common Algorithm Paradigms

| Paradigm                | Description                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Divide and Conquer**  | Break down problems into subproblems, solve them independently, and combine the results. |
| **Greedy**              | Make the locally optimal choice at each step.                                            |
| **Dynamic Programming** | Break problems into overlapping subproblems and store results to avoid recomputation.    |
| **Backtracking**        | Build up solutions and abandon partial solutions that fail.                              |
| **Branch and Bound**    | Systematically search for solutions while cutting off unpromising branches.              |

## Key Operations Algorithms Perform

- **Searching**
- **Sorting**
- **Traversing**
- **Optimizing**
- **Graph processing**
- **Mathematical computations**

## Summary

An algorithm is not just code — it’s a **blueprint for problem-solving**.  
Mastering algorithms means mastering the ability to write efficient, correct solutions for a wide variety of problems.

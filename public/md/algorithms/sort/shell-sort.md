# Shell Sort

**Shell Sort** is an **in-place comparison-based** sorting algorithm that generalizes insertion sort by allowing exchanges of elements that are far apart. It's also known as the **diminishing increment sort**.

## Key Concepts

- **Gap-based insertion sort**: Uses decreasing gap sequences
- **In-place algorithm**: Requires O(1) extra space
- **Unstable sort**: Equal elements may change relative order
- **Gap sequence**: Determines the algorithm's performance

## How It Works

1. **Choose a gap sequence** (e.g., n/2, n/4, n/8, ..., 1)
2. **Perform gapped insertion sort** for each gap
3. **Reduce the gap** and repeat
4. **Final pass** with gap = 1 (regular insertion sort)

## Time and Space Complexity

| Case    | Time Complexity       |
| ------- | --------------------- |
| Best    | O(n log n)            |
| Average | O(n^1.25) to O(n^1.5) |
| Worst   | O(n²)                 |

| Space Complexity | O(1) (in-place) |
| ---------------- | --------------- |

**Note**: Complexity depends heavily on the gap sequence used.

## Visualization

```
Original Array: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]

Gap = 3:
[64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
 64      12  (compare and swap)
    34      22  (compare and swap)
       25      11  (compare and swap)
Result: [12, 22, 11, 64, 34, 25, 90]

Gap = 1 (regular insertion sort):
[11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```

public class ShellSort {

    public static void shellSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;

        // Start with a large gap and reduce it
        for (int gap = n / 2; gap > 0; gap /= 2) {
            // Perform gapped insertion sort
            for (int i = gap; i < n; i++) {
                int temp = arr[i];
                int j;

                // Shift elements until correct position is found
                for (j = i; j >= gap && arr[j - gap] > temp; j -= gap) {
                    arr[j] = arr[j - gap];
                }

                arr[j] = temp;
            }
        }

    // Shell Sort with Knuth's sequence (3k + 1)
    public static void shellSortKnuth(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;

        // Calculate starting gap using Knuth's sequence
        int gap = 1;
        while (gap < n / 3) {
            gap = gap * 3 + 1; // 1, 4, 13, 40, 121, ...
        }

        while (gap >= 1) {
            // Gapped insertion sort

                arr[j] = temp;
            }

            gap /= 3; // Move to next gap in sequence
        }

        while (gapIndex < gaps.length && gaps[gapIndex] < n) {
            gapIndex++;
        }
        gapIndex--;

        // Apply gaps in decreasing order
        for (int g = gapIndex; g >= 0; g--) {
            int gap = gaps[g];

            for (int i = gap; i < n; i++) {
                int temp = arr[i];
                int j = i;

                while (j >= gap && arr[j - gap] > temp) {

        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};
        System.out.println("Original: " + Arrays.toString(arr));

        shellSort(arr.clone());
        System.out.println("Shell Sort: " + Arrays.toString(arr));

        int[] arr2 = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};
        shellSortKnuth(arr2);
        System.out.println("Knuth's Sequence: " + Arrays.toString(arr2));
    }
}
```

## Comparison with Other Algorithms

| Algorithm  | Time (Avg) | Space | Stable | Implementation |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----- | ------ | -------------- |
| Shell Sort | O(n^1.25)  | O(1)  | No     | Medium         |
| Insertion  | O(n²)      | O(1)  | Yes    | Simple         |
| Quick Sort | O(n log n) | O(1)  | No     | Medium         |
| Merge Sort | O(n log n) | O(n)  | Yes    | Medium         |
| Heap Sort  | O(n log n) | O(1)  | No     | Complex        |

## Historical Note

Shell Sort was one of the first algorithms to break the O(n²) barrier for sorting algorithms. It was invented by Donald Shell in 1959 and represented a significant improvement over insertion sort and bubble sort.

## Summary

**Shell Sort** is a practical sorting algorithm that bridges the gap between simple O(n²) algorithms and complex O(n log n) algorithms. While not optimal for large datasets, it remains useful for medium-sized arrays and systems with memory constraints.

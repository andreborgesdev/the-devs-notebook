# Data Structures

A DS is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

It Is a data storage format.

It is the:

- Collection of values and the format they are stored in
- The relationship between the values values in the collection
- The operations applied on the data stored in the DS

Why DS?

- They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms
- They help to manage and organize data
- They make code cleaner and easier to understand

We sometime have to create new data structures to solve different problems.

Each DS solves a different problem 

Contiguous data structure → The array is stored in blocks of memory that are right beside each other with no gaps. The advantage is that **retrieving values is very easy and fast.**

Non-Contiguous data structure → The structure stores a value as well as a reference to where the next value is (like LinkedLists).

### Operations on data structures:

- Access and read values
- Search for an arbitrary values
- Insert values at any point into the DS
- Delete values in the DS

Traversing (atravessar) is looping from start to end.

Prepend → Insert data to the head

Append → Insert data to the tail

Insert → Insert data at any point

Recursion needs a recursive case to call itself and a base case that causes it to stop.

An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is an abstraction of a DS which provides only the interface to which a DS must adhere to. The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.

F.e. List is a ADT and the DS can be dynamic array, linked list

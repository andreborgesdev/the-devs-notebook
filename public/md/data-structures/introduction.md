# Data Structures

A **Data Structure (DS)** is a **way of organizing data** so that it can be used effectively. It’s not just about storing data — it’s about how data is structured, related, and operated on to enable efficient algorithms and clean code.

## What is a Data Structure?

A data structure defines:

- **The collection of values** and how they are stored.
- **The relationships** between those values.
- **The operations** that can be applied to them.

In other words, it’s both **how data is organized** and **what you can do with it**.

## Why Data Structures Matter

- **Efficiency**: The right DS can make algorithms much faster.
- **Organization**: Helps manage and manipulate data cleanly.
- **Scalability**: Allows programs to handle large and complex data smoothly.
- **Problem Solving**: Many problems can only be solved efficiently by using specialized data structures.
- **Cleaner code**: Leads to clearer, easier-to-maintain programs.

## Operations on Data Structures

| Operation     | Description                |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| Access / Read | Retrieve values            |
| Search        | Find an element            |
| Insert        | Add values at any point    |
| Delete        | Remove values              |
| Traverse      | Loop through the structure |

Insertion examples:

- **Prepend** → Insert at the head.
- **Append** → Insert at the tail.
- **Insert** → Insert at any point.

## Contiguous vs Non-Contiguous Structures

| Type               | Description                                                      | Example      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Contiguous**     | Data stored in blocks next to each other in memory. Fast access. | Arrays       |
| **Non-Contiguous** | Data elements reference each other. Flexible structure.          | Linked Lists |

## Abstract Data Types (ADT)

An **Abstract Data Type** is an abstraction that defines the **interface** and **behavior** of a data structure without specifying the implementation.

| ADT  | Possible Data Structures |
| ---- | ------------------------ |
| List | Array, Linked List       |
| Map  | Hash Table, Tree Map     |
| Set  | Hash Set, Tree Set       |

## Sometimes You Need New Data Structures

While many data structures are standard, some problems require inventing **custom structures** or **combinations** of multiple data structures to achieve the needed performance.

## Summary

- **Data Structures = Efficient Organization + Effective Operations**
- Choosing the right DS is often the difference between an efficient solution and an impractical one.
- Mastering them is essential for:
  - **Algorithm design**
  - **Interview success**
  - **Building scalable systems**

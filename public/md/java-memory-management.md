In summary, suboptimally configured Java collections may waste a lot of memory. In many situations, this problem is easy to address, but sometimes, you may need to change your code in non-trivial ways to achieve a significant improvement. It is very difficult to guess which collections need to be optimized to make the biggest impact. To avoid wasting time optimizing wrong parts of the code, you need to obtain a JVM heap dump and analyze it with an appropriate tool.

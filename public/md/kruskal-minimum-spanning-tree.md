# Kruskalâ€™s Minimum Spanning Tree

Given a graph G = (V, E) we want to find a Minimum Spanning Tree in the graph (it may not be unique, we can have 2 paths with the same total cost). A minimum spanning tree is a subset of the edges which connect all vertices in the graph with the minimal total edge cost.

It is basically the minimum total edge cost we can have to traverse all the nodes.

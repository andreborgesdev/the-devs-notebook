# Subsets

A huge number of coding interview problems involve dealing with Permutations and Combinations of a given set of elements. The pattern Subsets describes an efficient Breadth First Search (BFS) approach to handle all these problems.

The pattern looks like this:

Given a set of [1, 5, 3]

1. Start with an empty set: [[]]
2. Add the first number (1) to all the existing subsets to create new subsets: [[], [1]];
3. Add the second number (5) to all the existing subsets: [[], [1], [5], [1,5]];
4. Add the third number (3) to all the existing subsets: [[], [1], [5], [1,5], [3], [1,3], [5,3], [1,5,3]].

Here is a visual representation of the Subsets pattern:

How to identify the Subsets pattern:

â€¢ Problems where you need to find the combinations or permutations of a given set

Problems featuring Subsets pattern:

- Subsets With Duplicates (easy)
- String Permutations by changing case (medium)

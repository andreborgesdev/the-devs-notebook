## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment

**Process:**

1. Maintain two identical production environments (Blue and Green)
2. Deploy new version to inactive environment
3. Test new version thoroughly
4. Switch traffic to new environment instantly
5. Keep old environment as immediate rollback option

**Advantages:**

- **Zero Downtime**: Instant cutover between environments
- **Quick Rollback**: Immediate return to previous version
- **Full Testing**: Complete validation before traffic switch
- **Risk Mitigation**: Old environment available for comparison

**Disadvantages:**

- **Resource Cost**: Requires double infrastructure
- **Database Challenges**: Complex with stateful applications
- **Configuration Drift**: Environments may diverge over time
- **Complexity**: More complex orchestration required

### Canary Deployment

**Process:**

1. Deploy new version to small subset of infrastructure
2. Route small percentage of traffic to new version
3. Monitor metrics and user feedback
4. Gradually increase traffic to new version
5. Complete rollout or rollback based on metrics

**Advantages:**

- **Risk Reduction**: Limited blast radius for issues
- **Real User Testing**: Actual user traffic testing
- **Gradual Rollout**: Controlled release process
- **Easy Rollback**: Quick rollback for small user subset

**Disadvantages:**

- **Complex Routing**: Traffic splitting complexity
- **Monitoring Overhead**: Requires sophisticated monitoring
- **Slower Rollout**: Gradual deployment takes longer
- **Version Compatibility**: Must support multiple versions

### Rolling Deployment

**Process:**

1. Update instances one at a time or in small batches
2. Ensure each instance is healthy before proceeding
3. Continue until all instances are updated
4. Maintain service availability throughout process

**Advantages:**

- **Resource Efficient**: No additional infrastructure required
- **Gradual Process**: Controlled update progression
- **Rollback Capability**: Can stop and rollback during process
- **Simple Implementation**: Straightforward to implement

**Disadvantages:**

- **Slower Process**: Sequential updates take time
- **Mixed Versions**: Temporary state with multiple versions
- **Potential Issues**: Problems may affect multiple instances
- **Complexity**: Handling stateful applications challenging

### A/B Testing Deployment

**Process:**

1. Deploy multiple versions of application features
2. Route traffic to different versions based on criteria
3. Collect metrics and user behavior data
4. Analyze results and choose winning version
5. Gradually shift traffic to better-performing version

**Advantages:**

- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Objective performance comparison
- **User Experience**: Real user feedback on features
- **Risk Mitigation**: Limited exposure to poor-performing features
- **Optimization**: Continuous improvement based on data

**Disadvantages:**

- **Complexity**: Requires sophisticated traffic routing
- **Analysis Overhead**: Need statistical analysis capabilities
- **Resource Usage**: Multiple versions running simultaneously
- **Time Investment**: Requires time for meaningful data collection

### Feature Flags (Feature Toggles)

**Implementation:**

- **Configuration-Based**: Enable/disable features through configuration
- **User-Targeted**: Show features to specific user segments
- **Gradual Rollout**: Progressive feature enablement
- **Kill Switch**: Instant feature disabling capability

**Benefits:**

- **Decouple Deployment from Release**: Deploy code without exposing features
- **Risk Mitigation**: Quick feature disabling if issues arise
- **Testing in Production**: Safe testing with real users

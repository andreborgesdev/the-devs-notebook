# Load Balancing

## Overview

Load balancing is a critical technique in system design that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple backend servers to ensure high availability, reliability, and optimal resource utilization. It acts as a traffic dispatcher, intelligently routing requests to the most appropriate server based on various factors and algorithms.

### Core Principles

**Traffic Distribution**

- Evenly distributes incoming requests across multiple servers
- Prevents any single server from becoming overwhelmed
- Optimizes resource utilization across the server farm

**High Availability**

- Eliminates single points of failure
- Provides automatic failover when servers become unavailable
- Ensures continuous service availability even during server maintenance

**Scalability Enhancement**

- Enables horizontal scaling by adding more servers
- Handles increased traffic loads efficiently
- Supports dynamic scaling based on demand

## Load Balancer Types and Layers

### Layer 4 (Transport Layer) Load Balancing

Operates at the TCP/UDP level, making routing decisions based on IP addresses and ports.

**Characteristics:**

- Fast and efficient (lower latency)
- Cannot inspect application-layer data
- Suitable for any TCP/UDP traffic
- Limited routing intelligence

### Layer 7 (Application Layer) Load Balancing

Operates at the HTTP/HTTPS level, making routing decisions based on application data.

**Characteristics:**

- Advanced routing capabilities
- SSL termination support
- Content-based routing
- Request/response modification
- Higher processing overhead

## Load Balancing Algorithms

### 1. Round Robin

Distributes requests sequentially across servers.

**Pros:**

- Simple implementation
- Equal distribution (when requests are similar)
- Low computational overhead

**Cons:**

- Doesn't consider server capacity
- Poor performance with varying request loads
- Not suitable for stateful applications

### 2. Weighted Round Robin

Distributes requests based on server weights/capacities.

**Benefits:**

- Accounts for different server capabilities
- More intelligent distribution than basic round robin
- Good for heterogeneous server environments

### 3. Least Connections

Routes requests to the server with the fewest active connections.

**Best for:**

- Long-lived connections
- WebSocket applications
- Streaming services
- Applications with varying request processing times

### 4. Weighted Least Connections

Combines least connections with server weights.

**Advantages:**

- Considers both server capacity and current load
- Optimal for mixed server environments
- Better performance than simple least connections

### 5. IP Hash (Session Affinity)

Routes requests from the same client IP to the same server.

**Use Cases:**

- Session-based applications
- Shopping carts
- User authentication systems
- Applications requiring server-side state

### 6. Least Response Time

Routes to the server with the lowest response time.

**Benefits:**

- Optimizes for performance
- Adapts to changing server conditions
- Good for latency-sensitive applications

### 7. Random with Two Choices

Selects two random servers and chooses the one with fewer connections.

**Advantages:**

- Better than pure random selection
- Good load distribution
- Low computational complexity

## Health Checking and Monitoring

### Health Check Types

**Active Health Checks**

- Proactively tests server availability
- Sends periodic requests to health endpoints
- Can detect failures quickly

**Passive Health Checks**

- Monitors actual request success/failure rates
- Less overhead than active checks
- May take longer to detect failures

### Health Check Strategies

**HTTP Health Checks**

- Tests application-level functionality
- Can verify complex application state
- Most comprehensive but higher overhead

**TCP Health Checks**

- Tests basic connectivity
- Fast and lightweight
- Limited insight into application health

**Custom Health Checks**

- Application-specific health verification
- Can test database connections, external dependencies
- Most accurate but requires custom implementation

## SSL Termination and Security

### Network Security Benefits

**Private Network Protection**

- Backend servers remain in private subnets/networks
- No direct external access to application servers
- Load balancer acts as the only public-facing entry point
- Reduces attack surface significantly

**Network Segmentation**

- Creates clear security boundaries between public and private networks
- Backend servers only accept traffic from load balancer IPs
- Enables network-level access controls and firewall rules
- Simplifies security group and ACL management

**Attack Surface Reduction**

- Only load balancer exposed to internet threats
- Backend servers protected from direct attacks
- Centralized security hardening and monitoring
- Easier to implement security patches and updates

### SSL Termination Benefits

- Offloads encryption processing from backend servers
- Centralized certificate management
- Enables content inspection and modification
- Simplifies backend server configuration

### Security Features

**DDoS Protection**

- Rate limiting and traffic shaping
- Connection throttling
- Malformed request filtering

**Web Application Firewall (WAF)**

- SQL injection protection
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention
- OWASP Top 10 protection

## High Availability Patterns

### Active-Passive Setup

- One primary load balancer handles all traffic
- Secondary load balancer on standby
- Automatic failover when primary fails
- Simple but potentially wasteful of resources

### Active-Active Setup

- Multiple load balancers handle traffic simultaneously
- Better resource utilization
- More complex configuration and synchronization
- Higher availability and performance

### Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB)

- Distributes traffic across multiple geographic regions
- DNS-based routing decisions
- Considers latency, server health, and geographic proximity
- Essential for global applications

## Performance Optimization

### Connection Pooling

- Reuses existing connections to backend servers
- Reduces connection establishment overhead
- Improves response times and throughput
- Requires careful connection lifecycle management

### Caching

**Response Caching**

- Stores frequently requested content
- Reduces backend server load
- Improves response times

**Routing Decision Caching**

- Caches load balancing decisions
- Reduces algorithm computation overhead
- Must handle cache invalidation properly

### Rate Limiting Integration

- Protects backend servers from overload
- Implements fair usage policies
- Can be applied per-client or globally
- Various algorithms: token bucket, sliding window, fixed window

# Microservices Architecture

## Introduction

Microservices architecture is a distributed computing approach to service architecture that structures an application as a collectio## Data Management Patterns

### Database per Service

```
Principles:
- Each service owns its data
- Direct database access only by service owner
- Data access through service APIs
- Different database technologies per service needs

Benefits:
- Service autonomy
- Technology diversity
- Independent scaling
- Failure isolation

Challenges:
- Cross-service queries
- Data consistency
- Transaction management
```

### Distributed Transaction Patterns

**Saga Pattern**

```
Choreography-based:
- Services publish events
- Other services react to events
- No central coordinator
- Better for simple workflows

Orchestration-based:
- Central orchestrator manages saga
- Explicit compensation logic
- Better for complex workflows
- Easier to monitor and debug
```

**Two-Phase Commit (2PC)**

```
Not recommended for microservices:
- Blocking protocol
- Single point of failure
- Poor performance
- Limited scalability
```

### Event Sourcing

```
Concept:
- Store events instead of current state
- Rebuild state by replaying events
- Immutable event store
- Event-driven architecture

Benefits:
- Complete audit trail
- Temporal queries
- Easy replication
- Natural fit for microservices

Challenges:
- Complexity
- Event versioning
- Eventual consistency
- Storage requirements
```

## Testing Strategies

### Testing Pyramid for Microservices

| Level       | Type             | Scope              | Speed  | Cost   |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ------ | ------ |
| Unit        | Component tests  | Single service     | Fast   | Low    |
| Integration | Contract tests   | Service boundaries | Medium | Medium |
| System      | End-to-end tests | Full system        | Slow   | High   |

### Contract Testing

**Consumer-Driven Contracts (CDC)**

```
Tools: Pact, Spring Cloud Contract

Process:
1. Consumer defines expectations
2. Provider implements against contract
3. Contract tests validate compatibility
4. Independent deployment enabled

Benefits:
- Early integration feedback
- Service evolution safety
- Reduced end-to-end testing
```

### Service Virtualization

````
Mock external dependencies:
- Third-party services
- Downstream services
- Infrastructure services

Tools:
- WireMock
- Hoverfly
- Mountebank
```ely coupled services. Each service is fine-grained, implements a business capability, and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## Core Principles

### Service Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service owns one business capability
- **Autonomous**: Services are independently deployable and scalable
- **Business-Aligned**: Services map to business domains
- **Decentralized**: No centralized data or governance model
- **Failure Isolation**: Failures are contained within service boundaries
- **Technology Agnostic**: Services can use different tech stacks

### Domain-Driven Design Integration
- **Bounded Context**: Each service operates within clear domain boundaries
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Consistent terminology within service boundaries
- **Aggregate Boundaries**: Services align with domain aggregates
- **Context Mapping**: Define relationships between service contexts

## Architecture Comparison

| Aspect | Monolithic | Service-Oriented (SOA) | Microservices |
|--------|------------|------------------------|---------------|
| Deployment | Single unit | Centralized services | Independent services |
| Communication | In-process | ESB/heavyweight protocols | Lightweight protocols |
| Data | Shared database | Shared data models | Service-owned data |
| Technology | Single stack | Platform standardization | Technology diversity |
| Team Structure | Large teams | Component teams | Small autonomous teams |
| Scalability | Scale entire app | Service-level scaling | Fine-grained scaling |
| Complexity | Internal complexity | Integration complexity | Distributed complexity |

## Service Decomposition Strategies

### By Business Capability
````

- **Event Sourcing**: Capture state changes as events

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication
**REST APIs**
```

Advantages:

```

**gRPC**
```

Advantages:

```

### Asynchronous Communication
**Event-Driven Messaging**
```

Patterns:

- Event Notification
- Event-Carried State Transfer
- Event Sourcing
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

Benefits:

- Loose coupling
- Better fault tolerance
- Scalability
- Temporal decoupling

```

**Message Brokers**
| Technology | Use Case | Strengths |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| Apache Kafka | Event streaming, high throughput | Durability, ordering, replay |
| RabbitMQ | Complex routing, reliability | Flexible routing, dead letter queues |
| Amazon SQS | Cloud-native queuing | Managed service, auto-scaling |
| Redis Pub/Sub | Low-latency messaging | In-memory speed, simple setup |

## Service Infrastructure

### Service Discovery
**Client-Side Discovery**
```

Service Registry: Eureka, Consul, Zookeeper

- Services register themselves
- Clients query registry directly
- Load balancing at client

```

**Server-Side Discovery**
```

Load Balancer: AWS ALB, Kubernetes Service

- Services register with load balancer
- Clients make requests to load balancer
- Centralized routing decisions

```

### API Gateway Pattern
```

Responsibilities:

- Request routing and composition
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request/response transformation
- Monitoring and analytics
- Caching
- Load balancing

Technologies:

- Kong
- AWS API Gateway
- Zuul
- Istio Gateway

```

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
```

States:

- Closed: Requests pass through normally
- Open: Requests fail immediately
- Half-Open: Limited requests to test recovery

Implementation:

- Netflix Hystrix
- Resilience4j
- Istio service mesh

```

## Testing Pyramid

| Layer  | Tests                           | Priority |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | -------- |
| Bottom | Unit tests, performance tests   | Highest  |
| Middle | Integration tests, stress tests | Moderate |
| Top    | Acceptance tests, UI tests      | Lowest   |

Mike Cohnâ€™s Test Pyramid recommends maximizing unit tests and minimizing slower end-to-end tests.

## Service Level Management

### Service Level Indicators (SLIs)

**Definition**: Quantitative measures of service performance

**Common SLIs:**

- **Availability**: Percentage of successful requests
- **Latency**: Time to process requests
- **Throughput**: Requests processed per unit time
- **Correctness**: Proportion of correct responses
- **Quality**: Degraded but acceptable responses

**Example SLI Definition:**

```
Availability SLI = (Successful Requests / Total Requests) × 100
where Successful Requests = Requests with 2xx or 3xx HTTP status
```

### Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

**Definition**: Target values or ranges for SLIs

**SLO Examples:**

- **Availability**: 99.9% of requests succeed in any rolling 30-day period
- **Latency**: 95% of requests complete within 200ms
- **Throughput**: Handle at least 1000 requests per second
- **Error Rate**: Less than 0.1% of requests result in errors

**SLO Setting Guidelines:**

- **User-Centric**: Based on user experience requirements
- **Achievable**: Realistic given current system capabilities
- **Meaningful**: Significant impact on user satisfaction
- **Measurable**: Can be monitored and tracked

### Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

**Definition**: Contractual commitments to customers

**SLA Characteristics:**

- **Legal Binding**: Contractual obligations with penalties
- **Conservative**: Typically more lenient than internal SLOs
- **Customer-Facing**: External commitments to users
- **Business Impact**: Direct financial consequences

**SLA vs SLO Relationship:**

```
SLA (99.5%) < SLO (99.9%) < Current Performance (99.95%)
```

## Error Budget Management

### Error Budget Concept

**Definition**: Amount of unreliability that can be tolerated within SLO

**Calculation:**

```
Error Budget = 100% - SLO
If SLO = 99.9%, then Error Budget = 0.1%
```

**Time-Based Error Budget:**

```
Monthly Error Budget = (1 - SLO) × Total Time
99.9% SLO = 43.2 minutes downtime per month
```

### Error Budget Policy

**Error Budget States:**

- **Healthy**: Error budget consumption below threshold
- **At Risk**: Error budget consumption approaching limit
- **Exhausted**: Error budget exceeded, SLO violated

**Policy Actions:**

- **Healthy**: Continue normal development velocity
- **At Risk**: Focus on reliability improvements
- **Exhausted**: Halt feature releases, focus on reliability

### Error Budget Alerts

**Early Warning Alerts:**

- Alert when 50% of error budget consumed
- Forecast alerts based on current burn rate
- Weekly error budget consumption reports

**Escalation Process:**

- Development team notified of high error budget burn
- Product owner involved in release decisions
- Executive escalation for repeated SLO violations

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Monitoring Philosophy

**Four Golden Signals:**

1. **Latency**: Time to serve requests
2. **Traffic**: Demand on the system
3. **Errors**: Rate of requests that fail
4. **Saturation**: How full the service is

**Monitoring Best Practices:**

- **User-Centric**: Monitor what users experience
- **Actionable**: Only alert on actionable issues
- **Timely**: Detect issues before users notice
- **Comprehensive**: Cover all critical system aspects

### Alert Design

**Alert Categories:**

- **Symptom-Based**: Alerts on user-visible problems
- **Cause-Based**: Alerts on specific system failures
- **Predictive**: Alerts on trending toward failure

**Alert Criteria:**

- **Precision**: Minimize false positives
- **Recall**: Catch all significant issues
- **Detection Time**: Time to identify problems
- **Reset Time**: Time for alerts to clear

### On-Call Management

**On-Call Principles:**

- **Blameless**: Focus on system improvement, not blame
- **Sustainable**: Limit on-call burden per person
- **Learning**: Use incidents as learning opportunities
- **Compensation**: Fair compensation for on-call duties

**On-Call Best Practices:**

- **Rotation**: Share on-call responsibilities
- **Handoffs**: Clear communication during transitions
- **Escalation**: Clear escalation procedures
- **Support**: Provide tools and documentation

## Incident Management
